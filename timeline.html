                        There was a close vote in both ents and chair elections and recounts were done. Cns was given an
                        award for his work on
                        committee over the year. Some ammendments were passed, including one removing the entry which
                        said
                        that founder members
                        should have free membership for life. Shadow video-ed the AGM. The post AGM bash was held in
                        Pravda.

                        The BBS has been replaced by flin, a terminal menu system, NNTP newsgroups, ytalk, a wrapper
                        around
                        the write command
                        called "hey" and a chat program. The first news reader after the BBS was tin, apparently slrn
                        was
                        more similar to the
                        BBS news reader than tin. Members complain that new system doesn't have as many options as the
                        old
                        one. Members complain
                        that new redbrick house is more complicated than old one.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Because tin didn't look like the BBS, plop wrote a newsreader which looked quite a bit
                        like
                        BBS,
                        called 'shite'
                        (apparently stands for 'shit emulator') this was the default for FLIN users for a while, until
                        it
                        was eventually renamed
                        to 'rbnews' (as it looked not very good loking at the w listing having 30 users using 'shite').
                        shite eventually
                        disappeared on the move to mother.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>The chat software was the result of development work done by Pooka and Plop. Pooka spent
                        some of the
                        summer beating
                        sense into a chat server called NUTS (Neil's Unix Talk Server), and he added lots of features
                        and
                        generally cleaned up
                        the code. Plop wrote a curses based client for NUTS, called ITCHY, hence Redbrick's main chat
                        software was bizarrely
                        entitled Itchy Nuts - "Imaginatively titled client heralding yapping on Neil's UNIX talk

                <ul>
                    <li>In October of 1995 a group of friends started the ball rolling on the idea of a computer network
                        in
                        DCU, run by students
                        for the students. Starting out with a battered 386 PC with 8 MB of RAM(dubbed Nurse), bits of
                        borrowed memory, their own
                        cash, and a lot of luck, they went about organising the D.C.U Networking society. The initial
                        build
                        of the Nurse was
                        performed on an 800MB hard drive (the first RB disk) in DrJolt's home computer on February 4th,
                        1996. Once recognised as
                        a society, they were allowed to setup a temporary home for the server in the Computer
                        Applications
                        facility, going
                        online in the postgrad area on March 5th, 1996 as dcuns.compapp.dcu.ie. Later, the society
                        received
                        its own subnet and
                        subdomain of dcu.ie from the Computer Services Department.</li>

                    <br>
                    <li>Having decided to try for an alternative to 'dcuns' as the domain name, 'RedBrick' was
                        selected,
                        DrJolt's suggestion
                        being inspired by the diverse and exciting architecture of DCU (at that time, most permanent
                        structures in DCU were
                        built of red brick). They were also able to find physical accomodation (the CA department being
                        unwilling to extend the
                        temporary arrangements) in which to store Nurse, under a desk in QG07. Nurse went online as
                        Nurse.RedBrick.dcu.ie on
                        April 9th, 1996.</li>
