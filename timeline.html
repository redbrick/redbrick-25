                    <br><br>There was a lengthy discussion on the newsgroups (redbrick.babble) about "Redbrick 2.0",
                    initiated by cammy (i.e. should
                    Redbrick combine all it's different web services to make "Redbrick on the web" for our members, make
                    things easier to
                    use ala Bebo, should we get rid of the command line NNTP newsgroups). (Copy of the posting can be
                    see on cammy's blog.
                    [1]) Redbrick web forums were started as a web alternative (parallel?) to the newsgroups.

                    The BBS has been replaced by flin, a terminal menu system, NNTP newsgroups, ytalk, a wrapper around
                    the write command
                    called "hey" and a chat program. The first news reader after the BBS was tin, apparently slrn was
                    more similar to the
                    BBS news reader than tin. Members complain that new system doesn't have as many options as the old
                    one. Members complain
                    that new redbrick house is more complicated than old one.

                    <br><br>Because tin didn't look like the BBS, plop wrote a newsreader which looked quite a bit like
                    BBS,
                    called 'shite'
                    (apparently stands for 'shit emulator') this was the default for FLIN users for a while, until it
                    was eventually renamed
                    to 'rbnews' (as it looked not very good loking at the w listing having 30 users using 'shite').
                    shite eventually
                    disappeared on the move to mother.

                    <br><Br>The chat software was the result of development work done by Pooka and Plop. Pooka spent
                    some of the
                    summer beating
                    sense into a chat server called NUTS (Neil's Unix Talk Server), and he added lots of features and
                    generally cleaned up
                    the code. Plop wrote a curses based client for NUTS, called ITCHY, hence Redbrick's main chat
                    software was bizarrely
                    entitled Itchy Nuts - "Imaginatively titled client heralding yapping on Neil's UNIX talk server".

                <h2>1996</h2>
                <p>In October of 1995 a group of friends started the ball rolling on the idea of a computer network in
                    DCU, run by students
                    for the students. Starting out with a battered 386 PC with 8 MB of RAM(dubbed Nurse), bits of
                    borrowed memory, their own
                    cash, and a lot of luck, they went about organising the D.C.U Networking society. The initial build
                    of the Nurse was
                    performed on an 800MB hard drive (the first RB disk) in DrJolt's home computer on February 4th,
                    1996. Once recognised as
                    a society, they were allowed to setup a temporary home for the server in the Computer Applications
                    facility, going
                    online in the postgrad area on March 5th, 1996 as dcuns.compapp.dcu.ie. Later, the society received
                    its own subnet and
                    subdomain of dcu.ie from the Computer Services Department.

                    <br><br>Having decided to try for an alternative to 'dcuns' as the domain name, 'RedBrick' was
                    selected,
                    DrJolt's suggestion
                    being inspired by the diverse and exciting architecture of DCU (at that time, most permanent
                    structures in DCU were
                    built of red brick). They were also able to find physical accomodation (the CA department being
                    unwilling to extend the
                    temporary arrangements) in which to store Nurse, under a desk in QG07. Nurse went online as
                    Nurse.RedBrick.dcu.ie on
                    April 9th, 1996.
